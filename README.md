# vfs [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/worldiety/vfs)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/worldiety/vfs)

Actually I've used and written already quite a few abstraction layers and
because each one get's better than the predecessor and Go lacks
a vfs which fulfills our needs, a new one has to see the light of the day.
